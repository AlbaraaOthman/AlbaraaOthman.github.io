#Repositries
For this project i have only my main repositry albaraaothman.github.io, within it i have a couple of **directories**

#Directories
I have the following directories:
* Habout
* _layouts
* _posts
* blog
* css
* images

## Habout

Habout is just a simple about page about Iron-Man, it was something i thought was enjoyable to do hence why i picked this character, it includes some internal CSS to change the page background colour and some external CSS to format the text to be centered and coloured.

## _layouts

_layouts stores the different layouts for each type of page, there is **default** which stores the bulk of the HTML and then **about** and **posts** which store a layout for these two pages so that all their subpages can be formated together, although both the layout for the about page and the posts page carry on from the default page which they implament.

## _posts

Stores the posts made to the blog, so far it has a site created post and i've added a post to show all the new markdown i've been learning.

## blog

Stores the index.html page for the blogs which allows users to select a post to view from the **_posts** directory

## css

Stores all the styling for the website.

## images
Stores the images used in the website, to keep it all nice and in one place.
